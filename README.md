Supply chain forecasting for inventory management project is essential for 
balancing product availability and cost-efficiency in today's dynamic business 
environment. This project focuses on developing a forecasting model that leverages 
real-time data analysis and advanced techniques to improve inventory management. 
The model integrates demand forecasting, supply forecasting, and safety stock 
management to optimize stock levels and mitigate risks of stockouts or 
overstocking. By utilizing a combination of time series analysis, causal models, and 
advanced machine learning algorithms, the system enhances prediction accuracy 
and adaptability to market fluctuations. This dynamic approach aims to create a 
more responsive and resilient supply chain, ultimately reducing costs, improving 
service levels, and enhancing decision-making in inventory management. By
